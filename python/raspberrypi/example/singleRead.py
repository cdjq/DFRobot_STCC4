    @brief This routine employs a single-sampling method, sampling once every 10 seconds and then entering the sleep mode.
    @n If you connect the humidity and temperature sensor, you can obtain the concentration of carbon dioxide and temperature and humidity.
    @n If the temperature and humidity sensors are not connected, the obtained temperature and humidity values is the default values.
    @details Experimental phenomenon: The read data will be output in the terminal.
