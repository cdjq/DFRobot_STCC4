    * @brief This routine employs a single-sampling method, sampling once every 10 seconds and then entering the sleep mode.
    * @n If the SHT4x is connected, it can obtain the CO2 concentration as well as temperature and humidity.
    * @n If the SHT4x is not connected, the obtained temperature and humidity will be the manually compensated values.
    * @details Experimental phenomenon: The read data will be output in the terminal.
